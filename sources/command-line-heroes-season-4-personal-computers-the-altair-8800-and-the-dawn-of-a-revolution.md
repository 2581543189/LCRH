代码英雄：第4季：个人电脑：牛郎星 8800 和革命的曙光
======
**00:04** - _Saron Yitbarek_

1974年12月一个严寒的下午，两个年轻人穿过哈佛广场，他们很可能在谈论他们最感兴趣的话题，电脑。

**00:19** - _Saron Yitbarek_

当他们经过报摊，看到杂志上露出了流行电子产品的蓝色字体。他们停了下来，封面上是一张金属盒子的照片，在它的前面有十几个开关和小灯。标题上写着：“世界上第一台小型计算机套件，牛郎星 8800。” 这盒子看上去并不怎么样，就像是给爱好者和修理工准备的。但是对这两个家伙来说意味更多，它就像他们一直等待的机器，因为他们正好有完美契合这种新硬件的软件。同时，他们也有一些惊慌，如果有其他人也有相同的想法并且已经开始实施的话怎么办呢？他们必须尽快行动起来了。那两个代码英雄是谁呢？比尔·盖茨和保罗·艾伦。他们并不知道牛郎星 8800 将会是个人电脑革命的门户设备，它将永远的改变我们和他们的生活。那台新机器还能做另外一件事，在一个神秘的小偷的帮助下，它将引发自由软件和专有软件之间的争论，敬请期待。

**01:50** - _Saron Yitbarek_

在我们硬件这一季的第一集，我们学习了分时小型计算机，比如老鹰。在第二集，我们听说了GE-225主机。但这些机器仍然受制于它们的尺寸、价格以及处理能力。这一集讲的是所有关于可以缩小到微型计算机的东西。这一切都是从寄给爱好者的DIY套件开始的，就像是给流行电子产品未来影响锦上添花。

**02:23** - _Saron Yitbarek_

这些简单的套件激发了一种革命性的想法，电脑可以放在你自己的家里。这台电脑是你的，并且可以用来做实验。这是一个全新的面向大众硬件部件的诞生，个人电脑。我是沙隆·伊特巴雷克，代码英雄，红帽的原创播客。

**02:51** - _Saron Yitbarek_

让我们回到60年代末，在新墨西哥沙漠，牵牛星 8800 诞生了。一个名叫埃德·罗伯茨的人与人合伙创立了一家立足于微型仪器和遥测系统的小型电子零件公司，MITS。通过爱好者杂志，他们可以向痴迷于无线电控制飞机和火箭模型的新市场出售工具。

**03:21** - _Saron Yitbarek_

1971年，埃德独立经营着公司。他决定将重心转向电子计算器-在当时这是一个全新的市场。MITS将提供第一台爱好者计算器。但是埃德失算了，他最初的联合创始人，阿甘·米姆斯。

**03:42** - _Forrest Mims_

像索尼、夏普和德州仪器这样的公司，他们正在制造专业的袖珍计算器，并以低于埃德的价格出售。这几乎造成了一场灾难。他濒临破产并且不知道该怎么办。

**03:57** - _Forrest Mims_

有一天，他了解到英特尔公司开发了一种新型的微处理器并在电子杂志上登了广告。我还记得那则广告，微处理器叫做英特尔 8080。

**04:09** - _Saron Yitbarek_

埃德大批量采购英特尔微处理器，因为当时没有人买。然后他通过微处理器设计了一台全尺寸计算机。

**04:23** - _Forrest Mims_

一天晚上，他给我打电话说：“我有一个新产品想让你看看。”于是我骑上自行车，骑到了MITS。桌子上有一个蓝色的盒子。他说，“它在这儿。”我说，“这是什么？”他说，“这是一台微型计算机。”我说，“你在开玩笑吧。”他说，“不，这是一台微型计算机，流行电子已经接受它了，并且他们想要一篇关于它的文章。

**04:43** - _Saron Yitbarek_

埃德的目标是为那些曾经在模型飞机和火箭的爱好者市场创造一个非常基本的计算机套件。他会通过流行电子杂志邮购这个套件。当你收到这个套件时，里面会有一个装满金属零件的袋子，其中包括一个包含了非常重要的英特尔 8080 微处理器芯片的特殊管子。埃德把整套设备的价格定在400美元左右。

**05:14** - _Forrest Mims_

他有一个问题，他说，“你觉得能卖多少？”基于之前我们通过流行电子销售的所有东西，我说，“好吧，埃德，天哪，也许几百台吧。”当我这么说的时候他看起来很伤心。直到今天我都感到内疚。在流行电子杂志刊登之后，在他们那幢小楼前的停车场里挤满了汽车。他们卖了5000台那种电脑。它被命名为牛郎星 8800。这个名字是流行电子杂志的工作人员想出来的。埃德不知道该怎么称呼它。

**05:50** - _Saron Yitbarek_

牛郎星 8800 是埃德·罗伯茨为了拯救他的公司而采取的一项重大举措，这是他做过的最好的决定。他当时没有意识到，但他做了一些真正有意义的事情。因为通过将A牛郎星以一个可承受的价格投放到公开市场，他让自己的机器暴露在比铁杆电子爱好者更多的观众面前。他的牛郎星打开了一个全新的从未想过能拥有自己电脑的消费者群体的潜能。

**06:28** - _Saron Yitbarek_

更重要的是，他们可以修补自己的电脑。这是一件大事的开始。但还有一个缺少的成分，软件。这个硬件需要正确的软件才能存活。

**06:51** - _Saron Yitbarek_

回到马萨诸塞州的剑桥，比尔·盖茨和保罗·艾伦刚刚在最新一期流行电子的封面上发现了牛郎星 8800。在他们进行哈佛广场的那次决定性的散步之前，保罗一直烦恼于比尔关于那些英特尔 8080 的新芯片，他在寻找一种使用这些芯片来创建软件的方法。

**07:16** - _Saron Yitbarek_

比尔和保罗用BASIC编程。正如我们在上一集中了解到的，如果没有GE-225主机，BASIC永远不会被创建并流行起来。对于比尔和保罗来说，BASIC的简单性使得它成为受限于内存和处理能力对象的理想语言，比如8080。

**07:38** - _Saron Yitbarek_

当他们看到杂志封面，看到8080芯片包裹的牵牛星时，他们意识到他们可以用BASIC编写软件来支撑机器。他们很快联系了MITS的埃德·罗伯茨。阿甘·米姆斯记得那个电话。

**07:56** - _Forrest Mims_

保罗说，“我们得给公司打电话，告诉他们我们已经拥有BASIC了,”盖茨同意了。但盖茨不想来打这个电话，因为他的声音太年轻了，而且他看起来像个青少年。保罗·艾伦打电话给埃德说：“我们已经为你的牛郎星准备了BASIC。”埃德说，“每个人都告诉我他们已经拥有BASIC了。”。如果你有BASIC，把它送过来，我会考虑的。”

**08:17** - _Forrest Mims_

他们并没有BASIC。因此他们在麻省理工学院和哈佛大学都不知情的情况下花了一个月借用了计算机的时间，为牛郎星开发了从未见过的BASIC软件。

**08:27** - _Saron Yitbarek_

比尔和保罗知道他们可以为牛郎星编写代码。但实际上，他们还没有开始。所以，是的，他们以马拉松的模式日以继夜地为了机器改写BASIC。使用发布的规范，他们在DEC PDP-10主机上创建了一个模拟器，以模拟牛郎星，然后他们开发了一个BASIC解释程序。

**08:53** - _Saron Yitbarek_

没有BASIC解释的牵牛星 8800 基本上就是一个带有开关和灯的金属盒，没什么用。然而随着BASIC解释程序的加入，这台机器突然有了真正的未来。

**09:10** - _Saron Yitbarek_

Just a few weeks later in March, 1975, the code was ready. Paul flew to Albuquerque to hand deliver the demo to Ed Roberts. Bill was up the night before, to make sure they hadn't mis-coded anything. He punched out the final code onto paper tape, and gave it to Paul right before his flight. But 30,000 feet in the air, Paul realized, they forgot one thing.

**09:39** - _Forrest Mims_

He realizes he had not developed the coder, or the bootstrap logger, that allows the computer to read the program. He wrote that code on the airplane. That's how brilliant Paul Allen was.

**09:53** - _Saron Yitbarek_

Now he was ready. The next day was the demo. Paul was going to test their code on a real Altair for the very first time. Here's Bill Gates in an old video from 1994, talking about the moment Paul Allen loaded that paper tape at MITS.

**10:13** - _Bill Gates_

The first time, for some reason it didn't work. The second time they loaded it in, it worked. Of course the simulator, it's very slow. Because you go through lots of instructions to a single instruction. So actually, the real machine, even though it's such a simple little microprocessor, was faster than our PDP-10 simulator. About five times faster.

**10:32** - _Bill Gates_

So to Paul, when it finally came up and it said, "Ready," and he typed in a program, "Print two plus two," it worked. He had it print out squares and sums, and things like that. He and Ed Roberts, the head of this company, sat there. They were amazed by, this thing worked. I mean, Paul was amazed that our part had worked, and Ed was amazed that his hardware worked.

**10:55** - _Saron Yitbarek_

Yes. Paul Allen and Bill Gates' BASIC interpreter worked like a charm on the Altair. An amazing accomplishment.

**11:02** - _Saron Yitbarek_

Ed Roberts was impressed. He was so impressed that...

**11:08** - _Forrest Mims_

He hired Paul Allen on the spot to be his vice president for software development.

**11:13** - _Saron Yitbarek_

Paul Allen moved to New Mexico pretty soon after that to start his new job. As for Bill, he went back to Harvard. He was still a student after all.

**11:23** - _Forrest Mims_

But Paul Allen convinced Gates to come back the summer of '75 and work with BASIC, and that's when they developed a company—they called it Micro-soft with a hyphen, Micro-soft. They eventually left out the hyphen.

**11:36** - _Saron Yitbarek_

MITS became Bill and Paul's very first customer when it licensed their BASIC interpreter and agreed to distribute their code with the machine. They called the software Altair BASIC and it became the first piece of software bundled with a personal computer. Now they just have to sell the thing.

**11:57** - _Forrest Mims_

What did Ed do? Well, they bought a big motorhome and made it into a traveling sales device, a traveling office to sell their computers. And they would drive this thing around the country and stop at different cities and have demonstrations and that attracted huge numbers of people.

**12:12** - _Saron Yitbarek_

MITS-Mobile, as it was called, took the traveling road show out west. Up and down the California coast, in conference rooms packed with curious engineers and tinkerers. The team showed off the Altair and Altair BASIC. Then, at a stop in Palo Alto, in one particularly crowded hotel conference room, something unexpected happened. Something that changed the course of software history.

**12:46** - _Saron Yitbarek_

Okay, hold up. Before we get to that unexpected something, I need to tell you about a group of electronic enthusiasts and hobbyists in the Bay area. They call themselves the Homebrew Computer Club. They trade parts, circuits and ideas, basically support each other as they explored this new world of personal computing.

**13:11** - _Dan Sokol_

Everyone was curious. Most of the people, they were engineers of one type or another. There were only 2 or 3 people who had any knowledge of computer programming at all. I remember a survey, how many people here had a computer versus how many people intended to get one. And that was really interesting because everyone was interested, and there were only 1 or 2 people who actually had them. And they would bring them to the club meeting and show them off. And I remember that the embarrassing question of the era was, "What are you going to do with it?" And nobody had an answer.

**13:46** - _Saron Yitbarek_

That's Dan Sokol, one of the original members of the Homebrew Computer Club. Their first meeting took place in a garage in Menlo Park and that meeting happened because everyone wanted to feast their eyes on the Altair 8800.

**14:08** - _Lee Felsenstein_

So 30 people arrived at this garage on a rainy night on March 5, 1975. And there was the Altair sitting for us to look at. It was turned on, but of course it had nothing to connect to and didn't do anything.

**14:22** - _Saron Yitbarek_

And that's Lee Felsenstein, another original member of the club.

**14:27** - _Lee Felsenstein_

We just went around the room and found out what we could learn. We've had a kind of more of a report from Steve Dompier, a fellow who had ordered an Altair computer and it was announced in the January issue of the Popular Electronics Magazine. And he had actually driven down to Albuquerque to check on his order, then reported back to us what he had found.

**14:48** - _Dan Sokol_

Dompier brought one in and he sat there programming it through this front panel of switches to get it to play music. And after spending about an hour doing it, somebody tripped on the power cord, and he had to start over. But at the time this was, "Look a computer—and you can afford it."

**15:08** - _Saron Yitbarek_

There was someone else at that inaugural meeting. When he saw the Altair, it blew his mind, but not because he couldn't believe a machine like that existed. Quite the opposite. Because a machine like that, and much more than that, already existed. He'd built it. That man was the young Steve Wozniak. A friend of his had coaxed him to go to that meeting so that Steve could show off a video terminal he built. But everyone was fixated on the Altair instead. Steve had never heard of it. And he also hadn't heard of the Intel 8080 microprocessor that was making it hum. So he took home a datasheet, and it led to an incredible eureka moment.

**16:01** - _Saron Yitbarek_

Here’s Steve Wozniak, “the Woz,” was speaking at the Homebrew Computer Club reunion back in 2013.

**16:10** - _Steve Wozniak_

I took it home and studied it, and I said, “Oh my God, these microprocessors are one chip.” Might sell for $400, that was scary. One chip, that is all the computers I used to design on paper back in high school, and I'd actually built one of those five years before, myself, when I had to build a processor myself. There were no microprocessors.

**16:31** - _Saron Yitbarek_

In our last episode, we learned how Woz started writing his own software in BASIC on the GE-225 computer in high school. Well, ever since high school, Woz had wanted a computer all his own. But to do that, he had to include a programming language that meant dedicating at least 4K of memory and human input and output to type in the programs. His machine had 256 bytes of solid state RAM and the chips for that were really expensive. So he designed a processor, refining it over and over while still in high school. It had switches to enter in ones and zeros, just like the Altair. But now he realized the Altair's microprocessor was the culmination of his vision.

**17:24** - _Steve Wozniak_

You press the buttons one, zero, one, zero, one, zero, and you press a button and it goes into an address register and press some more ones and zeros, and it goes into memory and it goes into memory. You fill up memory and it's so exciting to hear how we did that with the Altair that was playing the music in our club, but I was past that and wanted a machine ready to use, but now what I would do is type the data in and it would go straight into memory. How much easier that was. I said, "Oh my gosh, my dream of having my own computer." That night, I saw the formula.

**17:56** - _Saron Yitbarek_

That night, the image of the Apple 1 popped into Steve Wozniak's head. He could build his own fully usable computer for next to nothing by adding in a microprocessor to his terminal. And he had this idea that when his computer started up, it would run a program that would take in data that you typed into it, like a typewriter. No more switching ones and zeros. Add to that the video terminal he’d built to let programmers see what they were typing in and voila, a computer that felt more human. A useful personal computer that worked for normal people. Here's Lee Felsenstein again.

**18:42** - _Lee Felsenstein_

He had already developed a little video terminal kind of adapter, which the generic term was a TV typewriter. You would hook it to a TV. And he was introduced to the processor chip, which was being sold for $25 each, and realized, "If I put this on a board with some memory, I could put that TV terminal on the board, too, and I'd have a computer that would have a video display," which he did and he was working on that while he would be in the meetings. When we moved to the Stanford Linear Accelerator Auditorium, he grabbed the only seat with an electrical outlet. He would always be there before everyone else. He was writing the BASIC program for the Apple 1. He started the Apple family of computers there.

**19:34** - _Saron Yitbarek_

Once Woz finished building his computer, he was excited to show everyone at the club. He explained how a handful of chips could make an affordable personal computer. Woz was a big proponent of freedom of information, the sharing of knowledge to help build better systems and a better society. This echoed the club's open values and the social liberation movements of the time.

**19:59** - _Saron Yitbarek_

So at the end of the meeting, he passed out the blueprints to his design, the hardware and the software, for free to everyone. He figured they could each use his plans to build their own $300 computer. But Woz's friend and business partner, a guy named Steve Jobs, quickly put an end to that idea. You see, Jobs had been traveling all this time and didn't realize Woz was giving away the design to the Apple 1. Jobs didn't share Woz's hacker mindset. He was more proprietary. Jobs soon convinced Woz that they should sell the computers instead.

**20:42** - _Saron Yitbarek_

That ethical struggle between free and proprietary technology happened more than once at the Homebrew Computer Club. In fact, a few months after that inaugural club meeting, which had everyone gawking at the Altair, there was one more meeting that would light the fuse to this debate. It happened in the auditorium of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. At the end of that meeting, dozens of attendees rushed the stage to collect a program on paper tape, fresh copies of Microsoft's Altair BASIC, the new software that everyone was excited about.

**21:21** - _Saron Yitbarek_

But how did those copies even exist? The software hadn't been fully released yet, so how did it end up at that Homebrew meeting? Turns out the original paper tape had been stolen. It was the great software heist of the decade.

**21:44** - _Saron Yitbarek_

Okay. Let's dig into how this all came to be. Remember I told you about MITS-Mobile traveling out west to show off the Altair and Altair BASIC?

**21:54** - _John Markoff_

The company was demonstrating their computer with their software in Palo Alto on June 10, 1975.

**22:03** - _Saron Yitbarek_

That's John Markoff, journalist for The New York Times.

**22:06** - _John Markoff_

And the hotel was called Rickeys. Remember, the personal computer industry didn't really exist then, and most of the people who were interested in personal computers weren't really business people, because there was really no business software, and so they were demonstrating the computer to a real eclectic group. There were lots of people around in the new Silicon Valley then who were electrical engineers, they were programmers. There were all kinds of people who were interested in technology and interested in computers.

**22:39** - _Saron Yitbarek_

During that demonstration, one of the MITS crew was having trouble loading the software onto the machine. Keep in mind that at that time, software was punched onto paper tape and the tape had to be pulled through a mechanical reader to install the program. So while that employee was distracted and all eyes in the room were on the shiny new Altair, someone in the crowd spotted something else, a nearby cardboard box, and the opportunity of a lifetime. Inside that box were rolls of Altair Basic on paper tape. This person slid his hand into the box and wrapped his fingers around a long roll of paper tape. He pocketed it and left. No one saw a thing.

**23:36** - _John Markoff_

Somehow that paper tape got to a semiconductor engineer who worked at a company called Signetics, whose name was Dan Sokol, and Dan, he was very technical and he was also someone who had gone to the original Homebrew Computer Club meetings. So Dan had access to a relatively high speed paper tape copying machine, and he made a bunch of copies. Dan to this day insists that he was not the person who took the original paper tape, but that he got a copy of it and then he brought it to the next meeting of the Homebrew Computer Club and he shared it with the members there.

**24:17** - _Dan Sokol_

Amongst my nefarious activities, I am known as the world's first software pirate, and for a damn good reason. I'm the one who duplicated the MITS BASIC, the Microsoft BASIC paper tape. And how that came about was someone stood up at Homebrew and said, "Does anybody here have the capability to copy paper tapes?" And I raised my hand, and that's how I ended up with that tape and copied it.

**24:45** - _Saron Yitbarek_

Lee was at that Homebrew meeting when Dan handed out his pirated copies.

**24:51** - _Lee Felsenstein_

So what happened was that Dan Sokol made up 10 copies, we had it at the next meeting and said, "Here's copies of Altair BASIC. Now bring back more copies than you took."

**25:02** - _John Markoff_

The deal was that if you got a copy, you had to make a copy yourself and share it with a friend. This was sort of uncharted territory. There was no personal computer software companies at that point, and so it was really kind of the wild west and people sold computers and they shared software at that point.

**25:19** - _Saron Yitbarek_

This was 1975, and software was simply the stuff that you used to make computers work. Personal computing was a brand new concept. Hackers back then didn't have all the baggage associated with that word now. They just wanted to share their work to foster an open community with the free exchange of ideas and software. The heist and giveaway had set the stage for a debate that still resonates today. Should software be freely shared or should it be bought and sold? Well, Bill Gates certainly had an opinion on that. When he found out what happened to his software, he was furious.

**26:03** - _John Markoff_

When he realized that his BASIC programming language was being widely shared by the hobbyists, he wrote this irate letter to them accusing them of stealing his software and undercutting his ability to make a living.

**26:18** - _Lee Felsenstein_

Well, we got that letter. We read it in the meeting and there was one line in it saying, "It cost us a lot of money to develop this. We used almost $40,000 in computer time." Everybody in the room knew that computer dollars like that were phony. They were just an accounting trick. You didn't pay real money for them, and we were onto that, so we figured, "Complain away. We're going to keep doing what we're doing."

**26:45** - _Dan Sokol_

He called us pirates and thieves. We tried to be reasonable and rational and explain to him that you can't sell a piece of software for $400 for a computer that costs $400. It's very difficult now in this day and age to look back and try and explain the mentality that they were working under, which was the minicomputer mentality, and minicomputers were used in industry, and we were just a bunch of hobbyists building our own computers from kits. The only piece of functional software was this BASIC interpreter, which pretty much acted as an operating system. There was no such thing as an operating system back in 1974 in these personal computers, and we couldn't get through to him. We couldn't explain to him that, "Sell us the manual for 100 bucks, and let us just take the software." He wasn't hearing any of this, and for years Microsoft software was overpriced and pirated, pirated terribly.

**27:51** - _Saron Yitbarek_

The club members chose to ignore the letter. That's because back in 1975, copyright laws didn't cover software. There was no penalty for copying the software from one paper tape to another. That would change in 1977, but for a couple of years there, no law was being violated.

**28:12** - _John Markoff_

The irony here of course is that Bill Gates didn't create the BASIC language. He simply created a copy of it, taking it from its original designer who was a professor at Dartmouth University and basically making a copy and then selling it, so it all had its roots in sharing.

**28:31** - _Saron Yitbarek_

The heist, the tape, sharing, the angry letter. All of that led to a decades long war between the burgeoning software industry and those they considered pirates, but out of that struggle grew the open source software movement. Its core values are cut from the same cloth as those early hobbyists who ignited the personal computer revolution, because those hobbyists realized that the key to the future of personal computing lay in unleashing the potential of software.

**29:07** - _Lee Felsenstein_

The process of passing the tapes around and encouraging and building upon each other's results is really what made the personal computer industry.

**29:17** - _Saron Yitbarek_

Now, we never did say who the original thief was, the one who made the heist of that precious paper tape. That's because it's still a mystery to this day. Those who know prefer to keep it that way.

**29:32** - _Dan Sokol_

As far as how it was liberated, if you want to use that word, I know who did it, and I will not say because that person has asked a long time ago, to remain anonymous because it was safer, and so I have honored that and I will continue to honor that. So no, I was not at Rickey's, but the paper tape found its way to me.

**30:01** - _Saron Yitbarek_

In time, the personal computer revolution gave way to Silicon Valley and multitudes of VC-backed tech startups, but those tinkerers, those electronic enthusiasts and hobbyists, they never went away. In fact, they're stronger than ever.

**30:20** - _Limor Fried_

Hi, my name is Limor Fried, and I'm lead engineer and founder of Adafruit Industries.

**30:26** - _Saron Yitbarek_

Adafruit is an open source hardware company, part of a new revolution that started up in the past few years, the open source hardware movement, and this movement shares the same values of those early hobbyists. But it's gotten even better.

**30:43** - _Limor Fried_

The Homebrew Computer Club, I think, had that philosophy where people were coming in with their computers, and it was a little bit like, "Check this cool hack I did," and then everyone was like, "Damn, that's cool. Okay, next month I got to bring something better." And that is a positive feedback cycle that brings really good technological innovation. I think that hacker philosophy still exists. People have just more background and so what they think of as a cool hack has really, I want to say improved, but it has diffused, and I think that's good. But I think the values of sharing are still there and helping each other and working together and cooperation. That thread has passed through. I mean, it's in the entire open source community.

**31:32** - _Saron Yitbarek_

We're going to dedicate a whole episode to the emergence of the open source hardware movement so we can see how we've evolved and made space for modern makers like Limor Fried. Stay tuned for that, episode 6, in a few weeks time. But next episode, it's the discs that changed the world—floppies.
